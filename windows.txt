Getting Started With KevEdit
----------------------------
Follow the instructions in the Windows installer to install KevEdit.

To learn more about using KevEdit, activate its on-line help by pressing 'H' in
the editor.

Remember: You can open zzt files and saved games by right clicking them and
selecting "KevEdit" from the menu, or possibly even by simply double-clicking
on them. This will work in any directory!

New Features / Bug Fixes
------------------------
Windows installer defaults to running KevEdit in "My Documents" folder
F4 text entry wraps at end of line
Virtual shift in DOS display: toggled by F12
Flood/Tile Select discriminate by object char
Improved syntax highlighting (especially in help browser)

Bugs fixed:
Duplicator cycle speed
Params created for items on F3 menu
Stats editor panel updated after editing object code or passage dest
Reenter coordinates don't decrease every time a board is saved
Horizonal and vertical blink walls were reversed in F3 menu

Blatant Plug of ZZTUnder Project
--------------------------------
For better documentation, install KevEdit and ZZT Under Windows into the same
folder. If extended help is installed with ZZTUWin then it will be made
available to KevEdit when testing ZZT worlds and in KevEdit's online help. ZZT
Under Windows can be acquired from http://bitman.freeshell.org/zztunder/ .

Post Script
-----------
Technical support for KevEdit is not guaranteed. However, you are encouraged to
send an email to bitman <bitman@users.sf.net> if you have any questions,
problems, or praise. Also consider posting to the "ZZT Editors" forum on
zzt2.com if you have a general question. For announcements and general
discussion of KevEdit, visit the Forums on KevEdit's development page:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/kevedit/

If you find a bug, try to fix it and send in a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it. For the overzealous, you can do what bitman did join in on the
development if you find sending in patches too tedious. CVS is great for that
sort of thing.

http://kevedit.sourceforge.net/ is where you can check for new releases, get
the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
